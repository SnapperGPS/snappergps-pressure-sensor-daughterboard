## Files

* `gerber`: Gerber files and drill file for manufacturing the daughter-board.
* `bom.csv`: Bill of materials of the daughter-board components.
* `pcb.json`: PCB layout file of the daughter-board. Created with EasyEDA.
* `pick-and-place.csv`: Centroid / pick-and-palce file for assembly.
* `schematic.json`: Schematic file of the daughter-board. Created with EasyEDA.
* `schematic.pdf`: Schematic as PDF.

## Manufacturing

* Get some PCBs manufactured by a PCB manufacturer of your choice.
(I used [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com), [Aisler](https://aisler.net/), or [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) in the past.)
For this, upload the `gerber` folder to the manufacturer's website.
Choose a two-layered PCB with size 3.56 mm x 11.68 mm.

* If you want, you can also let the manufacturer assemble the board(s) for you.

## Assembly

* Solder the two resistors, the capacitor, and the pressure sensor on the daughterboard.
Ensure that the marked corner of the pressure sensor is aligned with the mark on the PCB.
I recommend solder paste and a hot plate (or hot air gun) for soldering.

* Solder the assembled daughter-board on a SnapperGPS receiver.
Note that only version v1.0.x and v2.0.x are compatible, **not** v2.1.x or 2.2.x).
The five pads on the back of the daughter-board should connect to the five pads on the SnapperGPS receiver.
The daughter-baord shall be orientated such that the pressure sensor sits in the corner of the SnapperGPS receiver.

* Package the whole assembly in a water/weather-proof way, which still exposes the gel-filled cavity of the pressure sensor.
For example, I used silicon potting for this, but you can also use a rigid housing with a 3.07 mm hole combined with an O-ring with inner diameter 1.8 mm and cross-section diameter 0.8 mm.

## Flashing

* Go to [https://snappergps.info/flash](https://snappergps.info/flash).
* Connect the SnapperGPS receiver to your computer via USB.
* Pair the SnapperGPS receiver.
* Select the `SnapperGPS-PressureSensor` firmware.
* Flash the firmware.

## Usage

Find instructions in the firmware repository.
